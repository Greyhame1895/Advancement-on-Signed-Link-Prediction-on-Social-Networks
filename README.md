# Advancement-on-Signed-Link-Prediction-on-Social-Networks
This project is an improvement based on the ideas presented in the paper: [Predicting positive and negative links in online social networks] by Leskovec et al, published in Proceedings of the 19th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2010.  For more information, see https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1772690.1772756.

The repository has three folders: Dataset, Preprocessing, and Modelling. The Dataset folder contains five original datasets in text format. The datasets used in the project consist of Wikielect, Slashdot, Epinions, Reddit, and Bitcoin. They are downloaded from SNAP library snaphttps://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html (Leskovec,2016). 
in the Preprocessing folderï¼Œ there are two notebook files in which data are transformed into CSV files. The modeling notebook is about feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
